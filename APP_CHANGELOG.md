  - Cleaned up root directory (10 essential files remain)
- **Language Materials**: Fixed path resolution for `language_materials/` directory
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive README in `docs/dev-docs/` with categorization

### Fixed

- **Phrasebook Topics**: Now properly loads from `language_materials/*/phrasebook-topics/`
- **Cache Invalidation**: Bumped cache version to 1.8.1 to refresh language materials

## [2.2.3] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed

- **History Reload**: History now reloads from database when viewing History tab
- **Session Display**: All saved practices now visible after logout/login
- Previous sessions were saved but not displayed due to stale session state

### Changed

- History tab refreshes data from database on every view
- Ensures users always see their latest practice sessions


## [2.2.2] - 2025-11-23

### Changed

- **Database-Backed Settings**: All user settings now saved to database instead of local JSON files
- **Settings Persistence**: Settings persist across devices and sessions for authenticated users
- **Simplified Storage**: Removed redundant local JSON history storage, database is single source of truth
- **Guest Warning**: Clear warning for guest users about temporary session data

### Fixed

- **Function Definition Order**: Fixed NameError by moving load_settings() before authentication functions
